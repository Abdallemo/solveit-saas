## D) Snapshot Summary

- **Done:** Many PSM cores — Auth, Posting, Escrow (hold + auto-release), Workspace, Solver Dashboard, Subscriptions, most Admin basics, real-time notifications.  
- **Partial:** Refund workflow (user request + hold done; mod decision UI/flow pending), Dispute handling, Admin monitoring/health, Error streaming (≈90%), Moderator tooling stubs.  
- **Not Started:** Mentoring (chat/video), AI features (categorization/moderation/mentoring), Analytics reports, Admin subscription refunds/cancellations, full moderator refund decisions.

---

## E) Notes
- Mentoring (chat + video) and OpenAI integrations are ** priorities**; once done, you’ll have ample time to add Monaco/PDF/3D viewers and polish.  
- Keep this file in the repo (e.g., `docs/progress.md`) and update checkboxes as you ship features.
